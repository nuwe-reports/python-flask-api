This repository is a Python skeleton with Flask & PostgreSQL designed for quickly getting started developing an API.
Check the [Getting Started](#getting-started) for full details.

## Technologies

- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [Flask REST framework](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/6.3.1/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)

## Getting Started

Within the [Makefile](Makefile) you can handle the entire flow to get everything up & running:

1. Install `make` on your computer, if you do not already have it.
2. Build the Docker image: `make build`
3. Migrate any DB pending task: `make migrate`
4. Start the application: `make up`

As you could see on the [Makefile](Makefile) script, you could just avoid those steps and just execute `make up`, as
**build** and **migrate** are dependants of it.

Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5050/ping` to see that everything is up & running!

## Overview

This skeleton is split into two main folders:

### APP

This folder contains the main Flask configuration. You will find there the core files to get the API up&running with the
basic Flask settings parameters.

If you want to tweak or change anything of the configuration, this is the place!

### API

Here you will find the different files to expose your URLs & endpoints, but also some folders to start coding and
organize your code around
a [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

You can use this as a starting point to continue with this architecture, or adapt it to your preferences.
